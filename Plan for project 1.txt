1.Read csv data
2.Function to output unique user stories
3.Function to check all complete tasks
4.Function Unique completed tasks
5.Function for unique incomplete tasks
6.Function for maximum Task id completed
7. Function to print the relevant data out to a csv??? (This may be messy) 

Notes:
Yes and no for duplicates indicates a no (and gate logic)

(Possible improvements -Going for a basic implementation for now)
--Going to try implementing an item class where the items are unique but each task is related to that item with a boolean yes or no

-- Need to dynamically create an instance of the class for each item when reading the file
-- Possible store each task in a 2 dimenisional list with it's yes or no
-- This then would mean sorting the tasks would be easier.
